export const synopsisForMiniAbout = `
Tidytube is a browser extension that continually watches the current Youtube tab and removes
unwanted elements from the page. tidytube started as a personal tool but I soon realised this could be something that many other people could benefit from using as well. tidytube will be completely free and open source forever.
`
export const howItWorksAbout = `
When you are on a Youtube page the extension listens for DOM updates on the page using a mutation observer. When there is a DOM update the extension will search for and remove unwanted elements from the page.
`
export const dataNoticeAbout = `
The extension keeps track of the sections removed on each page and displays them in the extension popup. Very little data is stored when using this extension, find out exactly what data is stored
